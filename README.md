Web side for a music school, that I am developing privately for a friend (below mentioned as "customer")

##  Development environment

## Customer requirements
The customer requirements were forwarded via a ppt files, which is contained in the Req/ folder

## Development and release planning

This page was developed for the Heroku cloud platform. Therefore it contains a Procfile.

The Heruko deployment provides a CI/CD pipeline, so that any integrated changes can be reviewed via a known domain, which is shared with the customer:

The customer plans to publish the web side on a public domain later, when the content is complete and final approval took place.
